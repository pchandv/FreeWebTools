It works entirely in the browser and can be hosted statically (e.g., GitHub Pages).

Additional tools can be added in `modules/`.

## Usage
Navigate using the menu links in `index.html`. Each module runs fully in the
browser and requires no server. Simply open the page and select the desired
tool. Conversions happen client side using libraries loaded from CDNs.

## Development
Simply open `index.html` in a modern browser or serve the directory with a static server.

Service worker enables offline usage after the first load.
