# Free Web Tools PWA

This project is a collection of offline-first tools bundled as a Progressive Web App.
It works entirely in the browser and can be hosted statically (e.g., GitHub Pages).

## Features (partial implementation)
- Multiple Images to PDF converter
- JSON to DataTable viewer
- JSON Tree View
- Income Tax Calculator with Form 16 auto-fill
- About page

Additional tools can be added in `modules/`.

## Development
Simply open `index.html` in a modern browser or serve the directory with a static server.

Service worker enables offline usage after the first load.
